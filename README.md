# C - By HectorMtz22

## Final Project of Structured Programming

For this Subject I create a folder in this repo called `final`

You can navigate to this folder or click the link below:

[Go to the final project](final/README.md)

## Homework 5

### Compilation

You MUST compile like this:

`gcc homework5.h homework5.c initialize.c final.c show.c getch.c stack.c getop.c game.c`

### Execute

You MUST pass a number of mines and size of matrix in args

`./a.out numberOfMines sizeOfMatrix`

All INT numbers

Also you can provide a seed like in the next example:

`./a.out numberOfMines sizeOfMatrix seed`

This one is also a integer value

## HOMEWORK 4

Please download all the source code on the folder

And compile everything like this:

`gcc calc.h getch.c getop.c stack.c hash.c homework4.c`
